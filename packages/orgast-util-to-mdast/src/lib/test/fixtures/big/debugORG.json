One of the\ndownside of the topological account is that it provides no way of calculating\nthe specific phase of a particle, only stating that in 2D such phase could\narise, so a geometric account would be welcome. It turns out that said geometry\naccount (the so-called Berry-Phase) relies, unsurprisingly, heavily on the\nphysical features of the system, making it difficult to reason about the\npossibily of a geometric explanation of anyons in the abstract. We therefore\nturn to a physical system which purportedly produces anyons: the Fractional\nQuantum Hall Effect (FQHE).\n"

This leads to exactly the kind of plateaux that are observed, with constant conductivities over a range of magnetic field. So the presence of disorder explains the presence of plateaux. But now we have to revisit our original argument of why the resistivities take the specific quantised values (2.3). These were computed assuming that all states in the Landau level contribute to the current. Now we know that many of these states are localised by impurities and don’t transport charge. Surely we expect the value of the resistivity to be different. Right? Well, no. Remarkably, current carried by the extended states increases to compensate for the lack of current transported by localised states.
